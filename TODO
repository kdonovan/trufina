* Switch to jimmyz's happymapper repo for to_xml support'
  - how to create new requests
* handle edge case of street_address, which to_xml yeilds <.> tag

* Parsing responses 
  -- add MailingAddress to parsing, or remove Residence qualifier
* Clean out stuff from before HappyMapper
* Do something similar to responses for Requests
  - figure out how to take in a bunch of seed data and request data and output the desired xml


FILL IN THESE AND SIMILAR FROM SCHEMA:
  Is the Trufina username available via the API?
    Yes, use the TrufinaUsername element to request the username of the Trufina user.   Refer to the truapi.xsd schema for information about this element.  
  What does the comparison string look like for the Age element?  Say I want to verify someone is over 18?
    <Age comparison=">17"/>



* Keep working until all implemented
* Make class methods, so Trufina.redirect_url, not Trufina.new.redirect_url
* Figure out how to best handle creation on the fly of request and seed data

* Fix requires in init.rb to be relative to file, not RAILS_ROOT (if still exists)
* Update template config yaml file to include all necessary fields
* Remove this TODO file :)
